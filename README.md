## ClimateCheck: Fact-Checking Social Media Posts About Climate Change Against Scholarly Articles

This repository contains code for creating the dataset for the ClimatCheck shared task. The task is defined as follows.

Given a claim in English extracted from a social media platform about climate change: 
1. **Subtask I:** Find all relevant publications related to it from a pre-determined corpus of climate change research publications. 
2. **Subtask II:** For each of those, predict whether the publication supports, refutes, or does not have enough information about the claim.\
The predictions for each claim should be a list of related articles and their labels.
